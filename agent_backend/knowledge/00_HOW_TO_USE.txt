[HOW TO ADD NEW KNOWLEDGE]
1. Create a new text file in this folder (e.g., "new_courses.txt").
2. Paste any information you want the agent to know into that file.
3. Save it.
4. That's it! The agent will automatically read it the next time someone asks a question.

[TIPS]
- You can add as many files as you want.
- You can use .txt or .md files.
- You can paste FAQs, event schedules, contact lists, or anything else.
- No need to restart the server.
