## 🛡️ RECORED STABILIZATION (COMPLETED)

We have now reached a state where **all** data-linked modules are standardized.

### 1. 📢 ANNOUNCEMENTS & MESSAGING
-   **Standardized Targeting:** Admins and Faculty can now send announcements to specific groups (e.g., "Year 1", "Section A") with 100% delivery accuracy.
-   **Format Tolerance:** The system automatically handles variations like "1st Year" or "Sec A" and converts them to the core format ("1", "A").

### 2. ⚡ LIVE ATTENDANCE (OTP)
-   **Standardized Sessions:** Faculty-generated OTP sessions now use normalized Year/Section data.
-   **Automated Marking:** Students' validated presence is saved into the database using strictly standardized formats, ensuring their attendance percentage is always accurate.

### 3. 📋 ACADEMIC PIPELINES (EXAMS & MATERIALS)
-   **Seamless Access:** Students no longer experience "empty" lists in Subjects or Exams due to formatting mismatches. 
-   **Reliable Filtering:** Backend queries now use "fuzzy-standard" logic (String/Number/Regex) to ensure 0% data leakage.

-   `Students`, `Faculty`, `Attendance`, `Schedules`, `Exams`, `Materials`, `Assignments`, `Courses`, and `Messages`.

**The entire Nexus ecosystem is now perfectly aligned and data-safe.** 🚀
